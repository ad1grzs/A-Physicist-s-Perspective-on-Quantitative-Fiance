# A Physicist's Perspective on Quantitative Fiance 📈🧠⚛️

Welcome to my self-driven journey into **quantitative finance**, where I approach financial modeling with a physicist’s mindset — blending theory, simulation, and real-world data analysis.

This repository is a structured portfolio of projects that progressively build core competencies. Topics range from stochastic processes to derivatives pricing, time series modeling, portfolio optimization, and more.

## 🌌 Philosophy

As a physicist, I'm trained to model complex, noisy systems — and financial markets are just that. The aim of this portfolio is to:

- Reframe financial models through **physics-based intuition**.
- **Derive and simulate** models using techniques from stochastic calculus and statistical mechanics.
- Integrate **real financial data** for empirical validation.
- Write clean, modular **Python code** for each concept.
- Document the journey clearly for future employers, collaborators, and learners.

## 📁 Project Index

| # | Project | Description |
|--:|:--------|:------------|
| 1 | [Geometric Brownian Motion](./1_Geometrical_Brownian_Motion) | Simulating GBM paths using Monte Carlo, with insights from Brownian motion and Langevin dynamics. |
| 2 | Black-Scholes Option Pricing | Analytic and Monte Carlo pricing of European options under GBM. Derivation and implementation. |
| 3 | Black-Scholes PDE Solver | Numerical solution of the BSM PDE using finite difference methods. |
| 4 | Portfolio Optimization | Markowitz efficient frontier, Sharpe ratio maximization, Monte Carlo frontier simulation. |
| 5 | Time Series & Volatility Modeling | ARIMA and GARCH models for asset return modeling and volatility forecasting. |
| 6 | Machine Learning for Finance | ML-based prediction of return direction and volatility clustering. |
| 7 | Exotic Options & Risk Measures | Pricing barrier/Asian options and computing VaR/CVaR. |
| 8 | Market Microstructure | Order book modeling and order flow analysis. |
| 9 | Optimal Execution | Simulating cost-optimized execution strategies (e.g., Almgren-Chriss). |
| 10 | Final Capstone Project | TBD — a large-scale project synthesizing multiple tools and data sources. |

> 🚧 More projects will be added as the portfolio evolves. Each folder is self-contained, with its own notebook/code, figures, and brief writeup.
